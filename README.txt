Created new README, which is called README_example_execution.m.

- MW 2015/09









TODO, update following text:
-------------------------------------
1) Create folder of type 2013-01-01 and save the excel file of the platereader '130101' in it
2) Copy the excel file 'plateCoordinates' from the main /platereader/ folder into the date sub folder and open it and adjust to specific position names.
3) Copy the matlab file 'ExtractFitPlateReaderData_General.m' of the main folder into the date subfolder. Maybe change the name form 'General' to '2013-01-01'. Open it and adjust the folder name (date)
4) create a remarks.txt file :-)
